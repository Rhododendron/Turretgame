<!-- A scrolling turret game

An experiment on mouse drag scroll on canvas. Use mouse scrolling to look for targets
and adjust your aim accordingly. Don't let too many targets spawn or your game ends!

The hit registration is a bit sketchy, it's usually good idea to try to hit slighty in front of the target blocks.
Some inconsistencies happen because the collision is checked only once per frame and the particular moment may or
may not be in the collision area.

The sky, ground and level in general are hidden subcanvases for quick and easy access. The whole game
world is always drawn hidden and the scrolling part is then projected from the full level view.

Scrolling is implemented through 3 event handling functions that register mouse down, mouse up and movement while keeping mouse down.
In both ends of the level view, overscrolling is prohibited through value checking.

The javascript code is a mess and probably causes some bugs. Would love to clean up, but the deadline is approaching.

Save game only saves level and score values.
